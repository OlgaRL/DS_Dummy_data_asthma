Using the data from the OpenFDA API (documentation at https://open.fda.gov/apis/drug/label/) to determine the average number of ingredients (spl_product_data_elements) contained in medicines per year.

Choose a method to gather the data
Transform the data as you see fit
Visualize and explore the results
The output should look similar to:

year   drug_names     avg_number_of_ingredients
2018   drugA,drugB    21
...

year   route      avg_number_of_ingredients
2018   oral       123
2018   injection  213
2017   ...        ...
